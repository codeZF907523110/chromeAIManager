# Modern CSS Feature Selection

Choose the smallest native CSS primitive that expresses the intent. Prefer semantics,
logical properties, accessibility, and interoperability over novelty.

## Selection Order

1. Start with broadly interoperable layout and styling primitives.
2. Prefer container-aware behavior for reusable components and viewport-aware
   behavior for page-level composition.
3. Use state selectors, HTML attributes, and native controls before JavaScript state.
4. Check the exact feature's live Baseline record.
5. Layer Limited Availability or experimental syntax over a usable fallback.
6. Verify syntax in MDN/specification and behavior in a real target browser.

## Core Modern Toolkit

- Layout: Grid, Flexbox, subgrid, logical properties, intrinsic sizing, `gap`,
  `aspect-ratio`, and container queries.
- Responsive design: range media queries, dynamic viewport units, container units,
  size/style/scroll-state queries, and preference media queries.
- Selectors and cascade: `:has()`, `:is()`, `:where()`, `:focus-visible`,
  `:user-valid`, nesting, `@layer`, and `@scope`.
- Color and visual design: modern color spaces, `color-mix()`, relative colors,
  `light-dark()`, gradients, masks, and `backdrop-filter`.
- Motion: `@starting-style`, discrete transitions, view transitions, scroll-driven
  animations, and `interpolate-size` where supported.
- Native interaction: popovers, customizable select, CSS carousels, interest
  invokers, anchor positioning, scroll snap, and overscroll control.

Never assign a static Baseline label from this list. Fetch the current status using
[`../live-mdn-fetch.md`](../live-mdn-fetch.md).

## Chrome 148–152 Additions

Chrome shipping information is a browser release fact, not proof of Baseline. Use the
listed demo for syntax and query WebStatus separately.

Some release features have no dedicated WebStatus ID yet. Keep their headers manual,
include the Chrome release source, and describe them as experimental/unknown rather
than forcing them into another feature's record.

## CSS-First Boundaries

CSS is the right tool for presentation, responsive layout, declarative visual state,
focus/target state, scroll-linked effects, and native control styling. Use JavaScript
when the request needs business logic, persistent application state, network work,
arbitrary data transformation, or unsupported interaction semantics. Do not disguise
JavaScript-required behavior as a fragile selector trick.

## Accessibility Checks

- Preserve keyboard focus and native semantics.
- Wrap non-essential motion in `prefers-reduced-motion` handling.
- Confirm contrast in both color schemes and forced-colors mode.
- Avoid hover-only or pointer-only access to information.
- Treat fallback content and controls as the core experience.
